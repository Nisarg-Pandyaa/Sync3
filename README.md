Project Title : “SIMPLE SENTIMENT ANALYSIS APP”<br>
<br>

Problem Statement<br>
<br>
Every day, people post thousands of reviews, comments, and opinions online. Manually figuring out whether these messages are positive, negative, or neutral takes a lot of time. We need a quick and easy tool that can instantly read and understand the emotional tone behind any text.<br>
<br>
Proposed Solution<br>
<br>
We will build a simple web app where users can paste any text and find out the sentiment in one click. The app will automatically analyze the text and show whether it's positive, negative, or neutral — along with a sentiment score.<br>
It’s designed to be fast, easy to use, and helpful for anyone who deals with feedback or online content.<br>
<br>

Technologies Used<br>
•	Python (programming language)<br>
•	Streamlit (for web interface)<br>
•	TextBlob (for sentiment analysis)<br>
